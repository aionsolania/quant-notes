## Optimization Problem

An optimization problem is defined as

$$
\min_{x \in \mathcal{X}} f(x)
$$

where $f : \mathcal{X} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is an objective
function defined over a feasible set $\mathcal{X}$.

## Constraints

Constraints restrict the feasible region and may be expressed
as equality or inequality conditions.

The geometry of $\mathcal{X}$ plays a central role in determining
solution behavior.

---

## Convexity

If $f$ is convex and $\mathcal{X}$ is a convex set, then any
local minimum is a global minimum.

Convexity simplifies analysis and ensures stability of solutions.

## Sensitivity

The sensitivity of an optimizer to perturbations in inputs
determines robustness.

Ill-conditioned objectives produce unstable solutions.
