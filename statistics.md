## Statistical Model

A statistical model is defined as a family of probability
distributions indexed by parameters $\theta \in \Theta$.

Observed data are treated as realizations of random variables
generated under this model.

---

## Estimation

An estimator is a function of observed data used to infer
unknown parameters.

All estimators are subject to bias and variance tradeoffs.

---

## Consistency

An estimator is consistent if it converges in probability
to the true parameter value as sample size increases.

Consistency does not imply finite-sample reliability.

---

## Uncertainty

Statistical conclusions are conditional on model assumptions.

Mis-specified models yield confident but incorrect inferences.
